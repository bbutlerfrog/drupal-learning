# Change Tracker

This Handy Change tracker module places a link in your admin menu that will always let authenciated users view 
any site changes you deem worthy of recording in a file called changelog.md in your site's root directory.  It will 
also create a change notice those users will see each time the content of that file changes
This notice will persist until users dismiss it or browse to the changelog.
